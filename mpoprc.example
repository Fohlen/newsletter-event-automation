# With modern mail services that publish autoconfiguration information,
# you can simply run 'mpop --configure yourmail@example.com' to get
# a basic working configuration.

# This file focusses on TLS, authentication, and the mail delivery method.
# Features not used here include mail filtering, timeouts, SOCKS proxies,
# TLS parameters, and more.

# Set default values: always use TLS, and chose a delivery method.

tls on

# Deliver mail to a maildir folder:
delivery mbox $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/mbox

# Define a mail account at a freemail service
account posteo
# Host name of the POP3 server
host posteo.de

# The company runs SpamAssassin, so test each mail for the "X-Spam-Status: Yes"
# header, and skip all mails with this header instead of downloading them.
# filter	if [ "`grep "^X-Spam-Status: Yes"`" ]; then exit 2; else exit 0; fi

# Set a default account
